Meeting 11/7:
  Today: 
    download dataset "folder A"
    upload in R
    function that fetch for min faces to be 20
    make directory in R will create a "folder B" that only has the data set of min faces in it
  Next Time:
    load image
    some demographic analysis of data set

  Start Powerpoint
  - what is PCA
  - math behind it
