# MathematicalFoundationOfDataScience
Project for MSSC-5931 Mathematical Foundations of Data Science class at Marquette University 

Meeting 11/7:

  Today: 
   - download dataset "folder A"
   - upload in R
   - function that fetch for min faces to be 20
   - make directory in R will create a "folder B" that only has the data set of min faces in it
   - load image

Meeting 11/9:
  - Josh's work on PCA
  - Time issue
    - resize
  - Resized using package imager 
    - cleans data and scales all image
   - plots original, resized, reconstruct
   - potenitally, prob not a concern - how to change pixel values so that the photos arent so dark
       - add to the gray scale maybe a percent
       - depending on pixel value, how would we choose that value
       - maybe when it not 0
   
Meeting 11/14:
  - Demographics Data Set done (13 women, 52)
  - Henri function to find name with picture number
  - Jen's and Henri's photos done
  - added some cleaning in beginning
  - how to use LR to predict
  
Meeting 11/15:
  - Josh talked to Dr. M about proj
  - updated code to fix PCA
    - potential error with black line at top image
  - created SVM and it predicts well
  - need to assign who is doing what from here on
  
   
   
  To Do:
   - Read.me/Powerpoint
   - Clean data- HENRI
     - make perfect environment that check if input is correct if not fail
     - Create main file
     - Create functions for basically every section 
   - Train and Split Data - HENRI
   - Prediction - JENNY
     - someone already in data set
     - someone outside data set
     - is there a significant difference between our pictures and the other pictures when it comes to prediction
     - any conclusions onto why its not prediciting
   - Powerpoint (listed below)
   - Areas of Improvement: look at other methods of prediction and see how they compare
   
  
 ------------------------
 HW:
   - 

  Start Powerpoint (<20 slides - 1 slide per minute)
  - Project goal
  - what is PCA and SVM in general and in our sense
    -  math behind it
  - whats our data set and what is the standards of pictures
  - What libraries were used
  - Method: Steps to complete experiment
  - Results of PCA
  - Results of SVM
  - Areas of Improvement
  - References


  Project goal:
  - how many components be used that give a good amount of explained variance
  - predict name associated with the face with good accuracy and fast
    - Add our faces
  - add more...
