# MathematicalFoundationOfDataScience
Project for MSSC-5931 Mathematical Foundations of Data Science class at Marquette University 

Meeting 11/7:

  Today: 
   - download dataset "folder A"
   - upload in R
   - function that fetch for min faces to be 20
   - make directory in R will create a "folder B" that only has the data set of min faces in it
   - load image

Meeting 11/9:
  - Josh's work on PCA
  - Time issue
    - resize
  - Resized using package imager 
    - cleans data and scales all image
   - plots original, resized, reconstruct
   - potenitally, prob not a concern - how to change pixel values so that the photos arent so dark
       - add to the gray scale maybe a percent
       - depending on pixel value, how would we choose that value
       - maybe when it not 0
   
Meeting 11/14:
  - Demographics Data Set done (13 women, 52)
  - Henri function to find name with picture number
  - Jen's and Henri's photos done
  - added some cleaning in beginning
  - how to use LR to predict
   
   
  Next Time:
   - potential error with black line at top image
   - Clean data
     - make perfect environment that check if input is correct if not fail
     - import our images and change values from 62 to 65
   - how to use LR to predict: together
   - print the name of the prediction
   
  
 ------------------------
 HW:
   - Get 20 pictures of ourselves

  Start Powerpoint
  - what is PCA
  - math behind it
  - whats are data set and what is the standards of pictures
  - What libraries were used
  - mean face and talk about how faces are not all centered and straight on


  Project goal:
  - how many components be used that give a good amount of explained variance
  - predict name associated with the face with good accuracy and fast
    - Add our faces
  - add more...
